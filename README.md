Code and maps for the 2023 30-Day Map Challenge

At the encouragement of some friends, I've decided to try the 2023 30-Day Map
Challenge. This repository contains the code and maps I've created during this challenge.

## Day 1: Points

#### Map: Historic Bridges of Brevard County, Florida

![Day 1: Points](day1_points/day1_points.png?raw=true "Historic Bridges of Brevard County, Florida")

For my first map, I decided to plot the area where I grew up: Brevard County, Florida. 
This map depicts the locations of historic bridges in Brevard County. The data is sourced from 
the [Florida Geographic Data Library](https://fgdl.org/ords/r/prod/fgdl-current/catalog) (BAR Historic Bridges in Florida - Oct 2023).

The colors for this map were selected from the first image of the Sebastian Inlet Bridge in [this article.](https://www.sitd.us/sebastian-inlet-bridge-in-design-phase-timeline-below) The Sebastian Inlet Bridge is identified with a triangle on this map.

## Day 2: Lines

#### Map: All Roads Lead to Rome...Georgia?

For day 2, I decided to plot the road system in Rome, Georgia. (Honestly, I just though of the saying "all roads lead to rome" and decided to run with it.) The spatial line file came from the [Georgia GIS Clearinghouse](https://data.georgiaspatial.org).

## Day 3: Polygons

#### Map: Vacancy Rates in Census Tracts in Washington, D.C.

![Day 3: Polygons](day3_polygons/day3_polygons.png?raw=true "Vacancy Rates in D.C. Census Tracts")

For day 3, I decided to plot the housing vacancy rates across census tracts in Washington, D.C. I also overlaid the boundaries for D.C.'s eight wards and added identifying labels. The data came from the [Washington D.C. Open Data portal](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::census-tracts-in-2020/explore).
